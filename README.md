# animator-plainjs
Plug and play animator that takes a series of images, and animates them with plain javascript in the browser. There are many ways to accomplish this task, I know. GIF maker etc. This was the one that fit the needs for this particular tool, however.<br/><br/>

Simply replace the 24 png images in the images folder with identically named images, and this will animate through your choice of frame rates from 1 fps to 120 fps...assuming your machine can handle it.<br/><br/>

It's important to ensure that all 24 images are of the same width and height. A fluid animation requires the edges to be in the same place they were in each subsequent frame.<br/><br/>

Must continue to remind myself that sometimes the simpler way is often the better choice, and not just for dev time's sake. (See animator-threejs repo to understand what doing it the harder way can sometimes get you).
